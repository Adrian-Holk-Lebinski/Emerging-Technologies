# Running the jupyter notebooks
In order to run the notebooks you will need to have python installed\
Python Installation: https://www.python.org/downloads/.\
*NOTE: Check the option to add python to your system's PATH VARIABLES, this avoids having to add it manually.* 

Follow these steps to setup jupyter notebooks:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Check if python is installed using this command:
    ```shell
    python --version
    ```
    If it returns something like ```"python isn't a recognised command"``` then you need to install python from this webpage: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
    
    Otherwise continue to the next step.

3. Run this command:
    ```shell
    pip install jupyter
    ```
    Jupyter should start installing

4. Go to the directory where you cloned/downloaded this repository and run this command:
    ```shell   
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This should open your default browser on this address: http://localhost:8888/tree, where you can access both notebook pages using the UI.
